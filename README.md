## Description / About the App


The Revenue Prediction App is a machine learning-powered web application that allows users to predict the expected revenue of a product based on its key features.
It is designed to be user-friendly, making it easy for business analysts, product managers, or anyone interested in sales forecasting to use the model without writing any code.

Benefits:
Quickly evaluate potential revenue before launching or adjusting pricing strategies.
Provides insights into how different features (price, brand, sales, ratings) affect revenue.
Simple web interface powered by Streamlit, requiring no coding experience

ðŸ”¹ How It Works:
The backend uses a Random Forest Regressor trained on historical sales data.
Categorical features like Brand are converted into numeric values using Label Encoding.
The trained model predicts revenue when users submit the input form.
